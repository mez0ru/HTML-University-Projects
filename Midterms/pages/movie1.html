                <h1>Titanic is both an intimate love story and an epic tale</h1>

            <p>Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster
                movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy
                runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to
                the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius:
                If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a “movie for girls,” but then there’s
                this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that’s gold.</p>
            <p>I fell hard for the romance. It’s right in line with some of the most time-honored star-crossed lover
                tropes that literature has ever served up. Rose is engaged to a cruel man whom she’s only marrying to
                save her family’s fortune, squandered by a profligate father; Jack is an artist and a free spirit who
                falls in love with her instantly and shows her what freedom could feel like. The film’s framing device
                ensures that we know the rough outlines of his fate and hers, but somehow Titanic keeps our attention
                regardless.</p>
            <p>What’s compelling is the fantasy, of being loved for who you are by someone who doesn’t want anything
                other than to love you — someone who would rather literally die than let you experience a living death.
                It fulfills the human desire, as Ebert put it, to be cherished, the experience of having someone look at
                you as if you fill their whole field of vision and spill over the edges.</p>
            <p>I finally understood why my peers were so dedicated to Leonardo DiCaprio. It’s not just his looks, though
                boyish charm never hurt anyone (he was 22 when he shot the film, and Kate Winslet was 21). Watching him
                act is pure pleasure: He’s natural and unaffected, and his grin says everything. I also understood why
                Titanic launched Winslet into stardom. In an over-the-top role, she was equal parts heroine, rebel, and
                action star all at once, and her laugh was infectious.</p>
            <p>Finally, I understood why so many people went back again and again to see the movie. It’s big and loud.
                There are gorgeous dresses and soft-focus moments and a below-deck dance party I never really wanted to
                stop. There’s tragedy and there’s comedy and there’s drama and despair, and everything looks so
                phenomenally, exorbitantly epic — in the realest sense of the word — that watching it feels like living
                through something, like having the pieces of your emotional furniture get pushed around.</p>
