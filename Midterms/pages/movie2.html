                <h1>Inception is a deeply philosophical movie wrapped in a multi-million dollars sci-fi story</h1>
            </font>

            <p>It is one of the greatest films of all time and our kids would look back at it as we do to 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p>
            <p>It is great because it is part of the very passion of the film maker — Christopher Nolan. He always liked the idea of lucid dreams and it fascinated him for years. He wanted to bring it on screen in a way that would leave everyone awe-struck — and he did just that.</p>
            <p>The script of the movie is extremely well-thought out and no other movie that I’ve seen surpasses the script of Inception in terms of how carefully did it have to be written so as to not contradict itself in the tiniest possible details.</p>
            <p>The characters in Inception are unique as well feel insignificant at times — very unlike of typical Nolan who believes in the integrity of every character. It’s largely because although we think all of the characters have their own unique presence, but if you look closely, everything seem to be revolving around only one character — Cobb. It feels like everyone else is there for him. Feels like a dream itself because characters, apart from one or two, don’t even have full names. Arthur, Ariadne, Eames, Saito, Yusuf, Mal — all don’t have a last name which makes me think they’re all just projections of Cobb’s subconscious.</p>
            <p>The music of film is beyond fantastic. Hans+Nolan=wonders. The old friendship and partnership of Nolan with Hans has resulted in production of some of the most recognizable and attractive compositions of the era we live in. It’s largely because Nolan gives Hans full freedom to do anything he wants instead of bogging down on him. Hans has experimented more with the Nolan movies than any other composer I know. Play his “Time” from Inception and tell me if you’re not in it.</p>
            <p>All in all, there are heck of other things that make Inception a masterpiece including Wally Pfister’s camera work and Nolan’s continuous approach of working with his core team from across different professions including acting, screen writing, music composition etc.</p>
