                <h1>Joker - an Evil incarnate</h1>
            </font>

            <p>And there are several reasons why it's so good. The first and the most obvious one, Joker. Joker is a villain of the villains, the biggest scammer and planner of all times, the most terrifying adversary that Batman has ever faced in the comic world.</p>
            <p>Joker isn’t your common villain who has some material goals to fulfill. He doesn’t want the mob’s money or power, or even the glory of being the most feared man in Gotham. No - he’s far superior to that. Remember when the mob gives him half of their money for killing Batman which he burns in front of their eyes without shaking his hands. He wants something more - or, to be exact, something drastically different from what everyone else wants.</p>
            <p>His desires transcend the material world and delve into mythological, religious even, world. He mentions several times that his and Batman’s rivalry is a constant battle between Good and Evil (in capital letters!) and it’s destined to go on forever. Joker is an embodiment of pure evil - incorruptible, uncompromisable, terrifying.</p>
            <p>His only goal is to corrupt the soul of Gotham and his citizens. But he doesn’t try to achieve that artificially or with his massive intervention. As he says, the insanity requires a little push. And since he’s sure that people are overly sadistic and evil rather than kind, he puts them in challenging situations so that they can “eat each other”.</p>
            <p>Joker is truly an embodiment of ultimate evil. As devil himself, he wants to prove to God, or in this case, Batman, that his trust in humanity is overrated and will definitely prove him wrong. His only goal is to plant chaos into this world. Chaos created by people themselves and not some external force of nature. Because people are capable, and even willing, to submerge into violence and treachery.</p>
            <p>That is why Joker cannot be topped by any other villain in pop culture. He cannot be bought or compromised because there’s nothing to offer to him.</p>
            <p>And then there’s Heath Ledger! Boy, he nailed this role down to its core! His every move, every word, and every emotion shows that he is a real Joker. You cannot find any flaw or imperfection in his act because he turned into his character. In fact, he was so submerged in it, it became one of the reasons why Ledger died.</p>
            <h3>Compelling Batman</h3>
            <p>Then comes Batman and Christian Bale which is also very compelling but not many people talk about it, since there’s Joker. Batman, in my opinion, is a Nietzschean character who is capable of inflicting evil and in many cases, he does that to his adversaries.</p>
            <p>However, his one principle stands above all and that’s the one rule he never actually breaks. For him, human life is the highest value and neither he nor anyone else has a right to take it away. Even in the case of Joker, he cannot let the biggest villain of all time die in his hands; that’s why he saves him in the end.</p>
            <p>Since we’re talking about mythology and religion, we can also see some connections between Batman and God, however, a more accurate comparison would be of Batman and archangel Michael. The latter is known for slaying the dragon with his spear which represents the repression of Evil itself. The same goes for Batman and Joker, although, he never kills anyone.</p>
