            <p><i>Fight club uses fighting as the perfect metaphor for doing painful things that are out of your comfort zone.</i></p></font>

            <p>If you watched the movie, you will remember when the Narrator was first getting in the fight with Tyler Durden, he was hesitant. He was used to his normal boring average life.</p>
            <p>Once he got in a real fight, and realized that, he still lived at the end. He wasn’t dead. His family didn’t hate him. He actually felt better. Fighting wasn’t so bad anymore, and he noticed that it actually made him feel better.</p>
            <p>Then when he went around to fight other people, he noticed that people won’t even fight if you provoke them! This is a metaphor for the fact that most people won’t get out of their comfort zone even if you try hard to help them.</p>
            <p>That is why the first rule of Fight Club is don’t tell anybody. Don’t tell anybody about your new strategy to get out of your comfort zone, because people will just think you are some crazy dude that isn’t logical or thinking in this real boring matrix.</p>
            <p>Looking at the movie from this point-of-view, shows you how obvious it should be to always get out of your comfort zone. Make it your addiction.</p>
            <p>If you get in a vicious fight every day of your life, then what normal day occurrence could ever scare you?</p>
            <p>The Narrator wasn’t worried about what his boss thought anymore, or if somebody called him stupid. He just got in a fight earlier this morning and almost badly hurt someone. When you are in the beast mode mentality of conquering your dreams every second, you start to realize how small these normal day to day obstacles are.</p>
